# PacMan
A demonstration of PacMan being simply animated to go back and fourth and open and close his mouth.
## Description
With the use of array's and a few functions, you can see PacMan go across the screen as he opens and closes his mouth before hitting the end of the screen and turning around and continuing to open and close his mouth.
### How To Use
It's easy. Simply open the Index.html file in your browser and sit and back and watch PacMan go back and fourth endlessly.
## Future Improvements 
I'd like to revisit this project and turn this into a fully functioning PacMan replica.
